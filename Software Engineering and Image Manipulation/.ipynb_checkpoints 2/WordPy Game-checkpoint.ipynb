    "By using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), you will create a program called WordyPy. In WordyPy, the bot you create must try to guess a five-letter secret word based on feedback given from the game engine. For each word guess your bot makes, the WordyPy game engine will give detailed feedback which your bot can use to increase its chances of winning."

    "The rules of WordyPy are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each guess must be a five letter English word. Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are used, and case does not matter.\n",
    "The game engine, which is written for you, generates a hidden 5 letter word called the target word.\n",
    "The bot, which you must write, attempts to guess that word. It will get up to six tries.\n",
    "The bot will be given the location of a datafile which has a list of allowable words (one per line). Your bot must read in this datafile and only make guesses from this datafile.\n",
    "After each guess the system provides feedback indicating if each character is in the correct position for the target word, and if not, if the character is in the target word but in the wrong position.\n",
    "The bot must be \"smart\" in that once it has identified the correct location of a letter in a word it must only guess future words where that letter is in the same position.\n",
    "We have written tests for these requirements; you must pass those tests to pass the assignment."
